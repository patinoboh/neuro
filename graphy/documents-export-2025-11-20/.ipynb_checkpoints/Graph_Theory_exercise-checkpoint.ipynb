Many \"real\" empirical graphs are scale-free, i.e. they have an exponentially decaying degree distribution. Finding efficient and simple graph generating algorithms that resemble experimentally observed graphs (small-world, scale-free, motif distribution...) remains an active area of graph theory research.\n",
